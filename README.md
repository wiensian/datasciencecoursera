coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The R script *run_analysis.R* reads the original training and test data sets of the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set* (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

It combines them to one data set containing only values on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
and creates a tidy data set with only one entry, the average value, for each person and activity.
